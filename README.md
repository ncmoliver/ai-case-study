## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**    
The business impact of ShotTracker has changed the game dramatically. Coaches now have iPads on the sidelines, that keep them up to date and informed on team/player performance metrics. Live broadcast televised games have changed, where they are able to show charts, graphs, and court zone maps to viewers.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**

***PER***    
Player efficiency rating tracks a players positive/negative contributitons per minute on the court. This is a useful statistic due to the fact that it takes into account all of a players statistics game by game. With the goal of an improved player/team PER, due to the fact the technology is built to show player and team weaknesses which gives coaches the weak and strong areas of their system. They can essentially target strong areas, while developing the weak areas which provides a huge comeptitive advantage for teams, because they have this information at their hands in-game as well.   

***Win/Loss***    
The rate of Wins and Losses could never be contributed to one thing. With the objective feedback, the goal is for teams to use it as a competitive advantage. Understanding what is working and what is not working, providing addtional time for coaches and teams to focus on solutions.

***Improve Baselines***    
Baselines can be formed used past data, although it will be very sporadic due to the nature of basketball. A baseline is a metric like an average, which provides a common level of past data that has reason. With consistent improved baselines, it could eventually show a particular pattern.

***App Downloads***    
Fan engaging through downloads are clear metrics that sthe new app features 

***Time Spent On App***   
The time fans, players, coaches spend on the app shows a clear indication of engagment.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**   

VR Training Products: With VR, I would suggest that they create glasses or goggle that also connect to the anchor. With this, possibly it could show players different drill statistics (reps, makes, misses), game speed they are moving at, up to create training courses where players are directed through the course, which is essentially down the court. With the time they will be directed, tested, which alleviated the mental control a player typically uses when they freelance. This images the game like scenario a player is facing in the game, but in a training environment.


**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**    

I believe this product would benefit the company because of the impact it would make on the player. The game of basketball is played so fast that it counters how you can give instruction in certain moments. Without putting the player back into that exact moment, it takes a lot of time and alternate methods which replicates the concept but not the exact moment. A visual representation would be next level in player develpment. This has the potential to provide an excct replication of the metrics of specfic players of all sizes, offensively and defensively, training the model on fundamental angles, lines, lanes and movements.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
##### VR Glasses    
*The VR glasses connects to the updated anchor to also locate the player and the metrics of the court to create the virtual environment* 
#### VR Software    
*The software is designed to control the features within the virtual environment.*    
#### Basketball, Wearable, and Anchor Software Update    
*The software within each device will need to be updated to connect and function along with VR features.*    

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**    
The technologies provided are appropiate for the solution because the technology they are currently using has a lot of the capabilities needed for virtual reality.    
Currently to create VR it r.
