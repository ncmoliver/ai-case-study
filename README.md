## Business Activities

**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**    

The specific problem ShotQuality is looking to solve is to help teams win more games, by using an algorithm based software that predicts the outcome of a shot.

**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**     

The companies intended customer are basketball teams. Currently there are 3 main leagues, NBA, College, and High School that track stats. Below are a list of the top 2, NBA and Colleges with basketball programs, which show a clear picture of the market size.     


| League          | # of teams |   
| ------------    | ---------- |
| NBA             | 30 teams   |
| College - D1    | 351 teams  |
| College - D2    | 304 teams  |
| College - D3    | 420 teams  |
| College - NAIA  | 213 teams  |
| College - Junior| > 522 teams|
    

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? What is the unfair advantage they utilize?**    

Solutions that this company offers that no other competitors offer is the direct focus on building a product that is designed to win. Every other competitors product tracks progress, provides visuals (as does ShotQuality), however it is provided to the coaches in a manner of a statistic. ShotQuality's software has created an algorithm with over 90 different variables involved (designed to alleviate biases) and is designed to provide statistics, daily updates, comparisons, game to game matchups and scouting reports that highlights the key factors that go into winning or losing each game. 

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**    

ShotQuality used AI technologies within an algorithm based software that is based on 90 different variables. Based on a podcast, Gerszerb breaks down some of the main factors that goes into the algorithm:
* Shot Making ability: A player natural ability to shoot the type of shot they are taking. 
* Type Of Shot: A catch and shoot shot naturally has a higher probability of going in than a shot off the dribble. A more drastic example, a layup has a higher probability of scoring than a 3 pointer. 
* Contested/Open: A player that has spaces and time to shoot the basketball, has more access to the muscle memory that they use to naturally shoot. Contested shots have the ability to rush, confine, or limit a players natural movement.

*Implementation*    

To train the model, Gerszerb spoke about the baseline he gave to the model which was statistics on the 50th percentile, comparing the difference between the worst and best statistic for each factor. From that baseline, he adjust the result based on player ability to make the specific type of shot taken.
